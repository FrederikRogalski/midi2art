# ChatGPT Prompt for MIDI2Art Background Image

Use this prompt with ChatGPT (or similar AI image generator) to create a background image for the MIDI2Art plugin:

---

**Prompt:**

Create a cyberpunk-style background image for an audio plugin interface. The image should be:

- **Dimensions**: 600x800 pixels (or higher resolution like 1200x1600 for retina displays)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support, or high-quality JPEG
- **Style**: Cyberpunk aesthetic with neon colors, dark background, futuristic tech elements
- **Color Scheme**: 
  - Dark background (deep blacks, dark blues/purples)
  - Neon accents in cyan, magenta, or electric blue
  - Subtle grid lines or circuit patterns
  - Glowing elements that suggest technology/lighting control
- **Layout Considerations**:
  - Top area (first 80-100 pixels): Space for a logo or title text
  - Remainder: Subtle pattern/texture that won't interfere with UI controls
  - Avoid bright areas in the center where controls will be placed
- **Mood**: Professional, modern, tech-forward, suitable for music production software
- **Technical Details**:
  - High contrast between dark areas and neon accents
  - Subtle enough that semi-transparent UI boxes remain readable
  - No busy patterns that would distract from controls
  - Consider a gradient or vignette effect to focus attention on the center

**Reference**: Think of interfaces from Blade Runner, Tron, or modern synthesizer plugins with cyberpunk aesthetics. The image should complement a dark-themed audio plugin interface with rotary knobs, sliders, and a color picker.

**Output**: Provide the image as a PNG file (preferred for transparency) or high-quality JPEG.
